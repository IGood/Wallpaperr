	Wallpaperr may be freely distributed, provided the distribution package

	No person or company may charge a fee for the distribution of

	By using the application you have accepted the terms of this EULA.


- Use
	Upon starting the application, Wallpaperr runs in the system tool tray.
	To quit the application, select Exit from the tray icon menu or
		File->Exit from the menu strip. Wallpaperr closes to the tray by
		default.
	Right-click the tray icon to access the tray icon menu. Double-click
		the tray icon to open the settings window.
	File->Show On Startup may be toggled to choose if the application
		starts visible or minimized to the system tool tray.
	Layout Style determines the look of the background.
		Zoom Out shows the entire source image on a background color with a
			margin on two sides.
		Zoom In shows the source image scaled to fit the screen with no
			empty space.
		Spiffy combines the other two settings to compose an image with a
			centered foreground image surrounded by a black and white
			border over a blurred background. Very nice.
	Multiple Displays is an option available to users with more than one
		display connected to their PC. The application periodically checks
		for more than one display.
	Automatic Changes determine the interval at which new backgrounds are
		composed. Timed changes may be toggled via the tray icon menu. The
		internal timer is reset each time the application is run or a new
		background is composed.
	Image Collection shows what files and folders are available to
		Wallpaperr.
		Items may be added to the collection via drag-n-drop or by using
		the menu strip selections and buttons.
		Activating an item in the collection (double-clicking with the left
		mouse button or hitting the Enter key with an item selected) will
		cause Wallpaperr to compose a new background using that selection.
		This works for files and folders alike.
		Folders included in the collection are monitored for changes. If a
		folder or file in the collection cannot be found upon request by
		Wallpaperr, it is removed from the Image Collection.
		Selections may be right-clicked to display a context menu.
		Collections may be saved and loaded via the File menu.
	The entire list of files in the collection can be accessed via the
		Collection->View Master File List menu selection. Activating an
		item in the Master File List will cause Wallpaperr to compose a new
		background using that selection.
		Selections may be right-clicked to display a context menu.
	Image Collections may be saved & loaded via the Collection menu.
	The OK button saves the current settings and closes the application to
		the tray.
	Pressing Esc or the Cancel button restores previous settings and closes
		the application to the tray.
	The Apply button saves the current settings and composes a new
		background using the new settings.
